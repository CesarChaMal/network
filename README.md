# network

Task

Write a class NetworkAbstract. The constructor should take a positive integer value indicating the
number of elements in the set. Passing in an invalid value should throw an exception. The
class should also provide two public methods, connect and query. The first method,
connect will take two integers indicating the elements to connect. This method should throw
exceptions as appropriate. The second method, query will also take two integers and should
also throw an exception as appropriate. It should return true if the elements are connected,
directly or indirectly, and false if the elements are not connected. The class can have as
many private or protected members as needed for a good implementation.
